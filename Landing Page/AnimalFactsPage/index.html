            <p>A cat is a small demesticated feline which first appeared between 5.3-3.6 million years ago. Because of how the cat's teeth are made, they cannot chew their food; instead, they cut it up. A cat has claws that come out and then retract. This gives them a weapon to use when they want to defend themselves. A cat is capable of turning their ears 180 degrees. This lets them move their ears to where the sound is located and the shape allows them to hear better. Some people believe that cats have a 6th sense which allows them to locate home from long distances away. Their ears move independently from each other which allows each ear to move to different sounds. They can also detect sounds higher than humans can hear.</p>
            
            <p> A cat's tongue has something called papillae which are backwards hooks that allow the cat to scoop up meat from pray and water when they drink. A cat's sense of smell is significantly better than that of a humans which allows them to look for pray and study thair food. They have 200 million oder sensors while a human only has 5 million. Cats can see <em>very</em> well in the dark. This lets them see their pray when it's dark. Many people believe their eyes glow in the dark, but this is the result of light bouncing off their retna. This helps them see in the dark better. Cats can find their way home when they're hundreds of miles away, we don't know hwo they do it, but one theory is that they use the Earth's magnetic field to find their way home.</p>
